# api-generator
The purpose of this project is to eliminate the need for writing boilerplate backend code manually by providing a fast, consistent, and scalable way to build RESTful APIs. By simply specifying fields like title, views, or is_active, users can generate a complete FastAPI application that is database-ready, production-safe, and fully extensible.
